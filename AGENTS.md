# enshrouded-mods

Server-side mods for Enshrouded dedicated servers, built on Ember, a `rust-app`
repository. [README.md](README.md) says what it is.

## Read first

Read these before changing anything, in order. They bind an agent as they bind a
person.

1. [README.md](README.md)
2. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
3. [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
4. [docs/install.md](docs/install.md)
5. [docs/mods.md](docs/mods.md), and the documents it links for the mod you
   change

## Verify

```sh
cargo xtask check          # the gate: every row in order, stopping at the first failure
cargo xtask check --rows   # print the rows and what each covers, and run nothing
cargo xtask pins           # the opening row alone: both mise pin files against their rules
```

[CONTRIBUTING.md#the-gate](CONTRIBUTING.md#the-gate) says what the rows cover
and what the gate does when a tool is missing.

## Never

## Deviations

A comment that calls a line a deliberate deviation records a decision, not a
defect. Leave the line as it is.

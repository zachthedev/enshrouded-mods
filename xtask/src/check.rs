//! The single gate.
//!
//! `CONTRIBUTING.md`, continuous integration and the pre-push hook all call
//! `cargo xtask check` and nothing else, which is what keeps them from drifting
//! apart. The rows run in order and the run stops at the first failure, naming
//! the row. `cargo xtask check --rows` prints the same table.
//!
//! A tool that is not installed is reported by name with the command that
//! installs it, and the gate stops there. It is never skipped quietly, because
//! a gate that reports a pass for a row it did not run is worse than no gate.
//! Every row that walks the tree hands its tool the tracked files it reads,
//! proves from the tool's own report that each one was checked, and fails when
//! none was.
//!
//! Every command goes through a [`Runner`], so a test drives the table with a
//! fake and spawns nothing. The one filesystem side effect outside the runner
//! is the canary workflow, written to a temporary directory of its own.
